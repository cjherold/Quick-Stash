# QuickstartDB

##### Quickly spin up a container and fill it with random data for practice or fun. Like grabbing a database from a pocket dimension.

-   [MSSQL](./mssql/readme.md)
-   [Mongo](./mongo/readme.md)

---

### Overview

###### Both folders have a similar layout and process. Here are some of the contents:

-   A docker-compose.yml file to get the container up and running easily.
-   Documentation that runs through the specifics.
-   A data-volume folder to persist data outside of the container.
-   A script to generate a bunch of data for your new database.

### Future Plans

###### I might add something for redis, mysql, mariadb, and postgresql.
